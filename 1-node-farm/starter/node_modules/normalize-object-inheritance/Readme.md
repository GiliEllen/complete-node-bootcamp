# Normalize object
A small recursive library which makes sure that all objects are an instance of the Object class.

Some libraries do not provide interoperability by returning arrays with completely empty objects (no `toString()` or `keys()` or `hasOwnProperty()` functions) which most libraries cannot deal with.

## You do not need this library
The following line fixes this problem as well: `obj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`
However this is ~20% slower than this library because it does not work in place and take cpu to serialize the object, which is not actually what we want.


## Usage
```javascript
import normalizeObject from 'normalizeObject';

obj = normalizeObject(obj);
```

To be able to normalize the root object, in case it is a null type object, it is needed to reassign the value to the output of the function. If you are 100% sure the root object will not be a null type object this is not needed.
